# WOGAMIFX.COM | Paragliding Sound Effects Libraries

WOGAMIFX.COM is a commercial website designed to showcase and sell two collections of paragliding sound effects for filmmakers, video game creators and audio professionals.

Being a professional sound engineer and a paragliding pilot, I've sound designed a few paragliding documentary movies and along the years, I felt the need to record pristine paragliding sound effects, location sound being rarely good enough to tell the story. That's how The Paragliding Sound Effects Libraries are born!

Built using Shopify and customized with EComposer, it combines responsive design, optimized browsing and streamlined checkout.

## Library Presentation

From immersive onboard acrobatic tricks and thermal flights to energetic take-offs, pristine wing & gear foley, natural wind flows and designed electronic devices, this library features an extensive palette of cinematic paragliding sound effects and atmospheres.

In this sound library, you will find 16 thrilling acrobatic tricks recorded in a breathtaking onboard POV, performed by the 4x Acro World Tour champion Théo de Blic. Infinity Tumbling, SAT, Mac Twist, Misty Flip, Helico and Joker are among the track list!

But more than those sensational tricks, this collection explores the many aspects of the sport, high in the sky or on firm ground.

We captured series of straight flight onboard sequences, including take-off, flight and landing, in pilot & wing POVs. Thermal flight onboard sequences were designed from scratch and separated in 4 stems for maximum editing flexibility: full mix, wind, variometer beeps and harness squeaks. 22 take-offs were captured in a close perspective, as well as ground handling foley and crowd atmospheres at launch sites.

The library also features extensive wing & gear foley performed in two flavors: outdoor environment and recording studio. In this section, you will find full sequences and single actions of gear packing & unpacking, wing folding & unfolding, manipulations of harness, wing, risers, lines, straps, buckles, helmet, gloves, inner bag, tube bag and backpack.

Electronic devices are key items in a pilot's kit. Based on the popular FlyMaster SD Series, we synthesized a whole collection of variometer beeps, alarms and melodies. We designed a walkie talkie and its voice prompts, beeps and white noise. Wind flows & gusts were recorded through an action cam's internal mics and in various non-formal setups for realistic and creative wind sound effects.

Whether you are sound designing for films, documentaries, video games or social media, this collection will add punch and detail to your soundtrack!
